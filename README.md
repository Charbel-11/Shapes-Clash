# Shapes Clash
Select your preferred Shape and jump into battle! This game was built entirely from scratch by Jad Haidamous and me, using Unity.

## Description
Shapes Clash is a fast paced strategic game divided into rounds where you have a few seconds to think and choose an ability to use. 
Take your pick from over 60 different abilities and 4 different shapes, predict your opponent's next move and think about yours wisely.

Each shape has its own elements affinity and abilities. You can choose to use Earth, Water, Fire or Wind abilities! 
The more powerful the ability, the higher its cost, therefore energy points management is extremely important. Both players start the battle with 0 Energy points and gain some each round. 

Outplay your opponent, counter his moves at a cheap Energy Points cost and take the lead with a huge advantage! 
Choose wisely from a wide variety of offensive, defensive and other support oriented abilities. Attack either from above, below or straight on and predict how your opponent will defend!
